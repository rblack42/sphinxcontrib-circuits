Publishing Project Documentation on GitHub

:Reference: http://raxcloud.blogspot.com/2013/02/documenting-python-code-using-sphinx.html

GitHub_ offers a free website for project pages to all open source projects.
This is an ideal place to post documentation for your project, and it is easy
to set up when using Sphinx.

In this note, I will show how to set up the documentaiton for a project I am
working on: `sphinxcontrib-circuits`_. Much of this material is derived from a
post I found (referenced above).
